# Ontario Park

## Description

Ontario Park is a geo-audio and realtime-locating mobile application that provides natural, cultural, and historical information and anomalies of Ontario parks based usersâ€™ interest. Our application aims to solve the problem of a lack of access of information of your surrounding when you are walking in parks.

Imagine walking in a part and seeing a beautiful plant or am amazing architecture but you have no resource to learn about what is that beautiful plant or what is the background story of that amazing architecture. Our application will provide you with that information as you are walking in the park!

To simplify the limit the scope of our problem statement, we focus on providing natural, cultural, and historical information in High Park.

## Key Features

- Backend:
  - By visiting the url https://ontario-park.herokuapp.com/api/attractions, users can retrive the following information
    - Getting a list of all the tourist attractions
    - The longitude and latitude of each of the tourist attractions
    - A description of each of the tourist attractions
    - A url to the audio file and the image file of each of the tourist attractions

## Instructions

The backend application is hosted on heroku and we currently have one route (get all tourist attractions) that is functioning. If users are interested in accessing the API of our application, they can simply visit https://ontario-park.herokuapp.com/api/attractions.

An APK file called Phase-2.apk has already been generated and placed at the deliverable-2 directory for you to load on an Android device.

### Map Page (Home page)

- No registrations are needed.
- Consists of an interactive map and features you can interact with.

#### Map

- Drag the map in the desired direction to explore different parts of the park and the markers highlighting the locations of infrastructures.

#### Map Marker

- Click on any red map markers on the map.
- This displays the subject of the location of infrastructure right above the marker.

#### View Detail of Infrastructure

- Click on any red map markers on the map. It should display the subject of the location of infrastructure right above the marker.
- Click on the subject tag that appeared above the marker you just clicked.
- This takes you to the detail page, where you can read more information about the infrastructure.

#### Play Audio

- Before you click on the play-audio button, click on a marker you are interested in. Otherwise, it will play the audio of the default subject.
- Click on the button with a play-audio icon located at the bottom-middle of the map page.
- This plays the audio of the marker you have clicked on.
- Click on the button again to stop the audio.

#### Go to Setting

- Click on the button with a setting icon located at the bottom-left of the map page.
- This takes you to the setting page where you can set the accessibility mode.

### Detail Page

- Consists of a title, an image, and a description of the infrastructure.

#### Back to Map

- Click on the back button on the top-left of the detail page.
- This takes you back to the map page.

### Setting Page

- Consists of a switch that enables or disables the accessibility mode.

#### Back to Map / Accessibility Mode

- Click on the back button on the top-left of the setting page.
- If accessibility mode is disabled, this takes you back to the map page.
- If accessibility mode is enabled, this takes you to the accessibility page.

### Accessibility Mode

- Consists of all the infrastructures and their audio.

#### Play Audio

- Click on a play-audio button next to a subject.
- This plays the audio of the related topic.
- Click on the same button again to stop the audio.

#### Back to Setting

- Click on the button on the top-left of the accessibility page.

## Development requirements

### Front End Development Installing

**developer need to do installation both on the mobile device and PC to run the application**.

#### Installation on PC

install Node js in the local machine.

```
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```

install expo in the local machine (Windows):

```
npm install expo-cli --global
```

install expo in the local machine (Linux/MacOS):

```
sudo npm install expo-cli --global
```

Clone this repository to local machine.

```
https://github.com/csc301-fall-2020/team-project-15-ontario-parks.git
```

change directory on terminal to the project front end location and run npm i to install all the dependency.

```
cd <project_location>
cd ./deliverable-2/MobileFrontend/OntarioPark
npm i
```

### Installing on mobile device

**ios device:**

- open app store on the device and download _Expo Client_.

**android device:**

- open Google Play store on the device and download _Expo_.

### Backend Development Installing:

- Install Node.js on your local machine.
- Step into the backend project directory and run `npm install` in terminal
- Run `npm start` in terminal

## Deployment and Github Workflow

- Frontend:

  We made a branch called MobileUI where the mobile frontend development takes place. Each member in the frontend team is responsible for one or two screens and we allocate the rest of the work(such as connection with backend) in a case by case manner. This allows us to prevent conflicts since we are working on different part of the same code base.

  We tried to make pull requests on the MobileUI branch for parts and any other team member who reviews the code can merge it. However, we are not able to continue using this because of our time constraint and because all of our components are closely related and need to interact between each other. We are planning to adopt the workflow described above in Phase 3 as we will be adding new features rather than creating everything all at once.

  We chose camel case for our naming as this is the standard for javascript.

  As we are developing React Native application using Expo, we are able to view the live application as we are writing and modifying the code and that is our deployment process when writing code. Expo also acts as a package manager and provides us the ability to link resources automatically and provide service for building and deploying the application as an apk file. We only use Expo to deploy to apk when we are finished because, as stated above, we are able to see live updates on our simulator/device when developing.

  We chose the workflow using pull request because it adds another guard towards erroneous code and prevents it from merging into more important branches. However, this is also why we did not employ it for the same reason as we are all writing code that are interdependent. We used Expo for our deployment because it offers features such as ability to see the update to the application directly on the phone that substantially improves our efficiency when making changes.

- Backend:

  Each team member in the backend team is responsible for handling one portion of the backend application. Ka Chun Mo first setup the code and the folder structure of the backend application, connected the application to our database (MongoDB), and hosted the application on heroku. Zhiyuan Sun then implemented the API of our application. Wang Ting Shu is responsible for setting up the crucial part of storing our audio and image files in our DigitalOcean server. Since we divided our tasks in a sequential manner, there is no conflicts in our backend applications.

## Licenses

- Currently we choose not to have an open source licence because of two reasons:

  Our partner is not in the tech industry and may not understand the implication of open sourcing.
  
  Ontario Parks is a government institution and we do not understand the requirements and implication of this fact on open sourcing.
